# Log Buckets

Log buckets are commonly required to collect AWS-generated logs for monitoring and observability. We provide two types of log bucket components to make creating these buckets straightforward.

## RegionalLogBucket

* [Schema source code](https://github.com/dinghydev/dinghy/blob/main/core/tf-aws/src/foundation/RegionalLogBucket.tsx)

Region based log bucket

```js
import { RegionalLogBucket } from "@dinghy/tf-aws"

<RegionalLogBucket/>
```
## GlobalLogBucket

* [Schema source code](https://github.com/dinghydev/dinghy/blob/main/core/tf-aws/src/foundation/GlobalLogBucket.tsx)

Global log bucket that is always created in the `us-east-1` region. This is required for certain AWS services, such as CloudFront, that only support v1 access logging to buckets in this specific region.

```js
import { GlobalLogBucket } from "@dinghy/tf-aws"

<GlobalLogBucket/>
```
