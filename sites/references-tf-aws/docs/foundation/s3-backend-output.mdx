# S3 Backend Output

A utility component that writes the Terraform outputs as a JSON object into the same S3 bucket used for your state backend, using a [S3BucketObject](https://dinghy.dev/references/tf-aws/services/s3#awss3bucketobject) resource. This makes your stack’s output values easily accessible and shareable via S3.

## Usage

* [Schema source code](https://github.com/dinghydev/dinghy/blob/main/core/tf-aws/src/foundation/S3BackendOutput.tsx)

You can see an example of its usage in the [Ec2Servers.tsx](https://github.com/dinghydev/dinghy/blob/main/core/tf-aws/src/composites/ec2/Ec2Servers.tsx) composite component.

```js
import { S3BackendOutput } from "@dinghy/tf-aws"

<S3BackendOutput/>
```
