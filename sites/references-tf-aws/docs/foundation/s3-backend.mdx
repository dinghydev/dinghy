# S3 Backend

Utilize this component to set up the Terraform [S3 Backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend/s3) for managing your remote state.

## Usage

* [Schema source code](https://github.com/dinghydev/dinghy/blob/main/core/tf-aws/src/foundation/S3Backend.tsx)

By default, this component assumes the backend bucket does not exist and will create it during the first `tf init` command. To prevent automatic bucket creation, set `createBackend=false`.

```js
import { S3Backend } from "@dinghy/tf-aws"

<S3Backend/>
```
