# Cloudfront Sites

Examples to use the [CloudfrontSites composite component](https://github.com/dinghydev/dinghy/blob/main/core/tf-aws/src/composites/cloudfront-sites/CloudfrontSites.tsx) ([schema](https://github.com/dinghydev/dinghy/blob/main/core/tf-aws/src/composites/cloudfront-sites/useCloudfrontSites.ts)) for building CloudFront-backed static sites. All you need is the referenced domain zone in Route53. This component automatically handles:

1. log buckets creation
1. s3 origin creation with logging and policy
1. cloudfront distribution creation with logging and access policy
1. ssl certification creation with options to rotate
1. domain redirect to the main site with seperate ssl cert
1. sub path redirect
1. sub site with different origin

Only s3 origin supported at the moment.
