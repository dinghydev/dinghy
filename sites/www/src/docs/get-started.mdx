# Get Started

Dinghy is an open source toolchain designed for your Diagram as Code and
Infrastructure as Code workflows.

At it's core, it use React as a templating engine to render your data model into target: [draw.io](https://draw.io) based
diagram or [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) (OpenToufu/CloudFormation in the future) based
infrastruture.

All those powerful technologies are delivered via a simple Cli through Docker.
Under the hood, the stable Cli drive the versioned Engine to perform critical
operations in a fast, reliable and predicatable way, all based on Deno runtime
with zero language configuration.

:::tip

The project embraces the spirit of a dinghy - simple, reliable and fun to sail
with.

:::

## Quick install

Install the latest Dinghy Cli on your system using the terminal command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.dinghy.dev/install.sh | sh
```

If you have trouble install, please refering
[Installation > Prerequisites](./get-started/installation.md#prerequisites) section for
resolution.

## Basic example

### app.tsx

Create one of simplest dinghy application as single file:

<CodeBlock language="tsx" title="app.tsx">
  {AppTsx}
</CodeBlock>

Don't be put off by all those Shape components, it's just a simple example for
demo purpose. Most time you will write more expressive code. The
[Step by Step](/get-started/step-by-step) guide shows how the code could
progress from a simple Shape component.

### Run

Then from same directory, run:

```
dinghy render
```

### Diagram

It will generate a few files in `output` folder include the image `app.png`:
