commonly used by developers and widely available on most platforms.

### Shell environment

The Shell installer can be used on Windows with
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)
or equivalent set of tools.

### Unzip or 7z

[`unzip`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/unzip) or
[`7z`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/7z) must be available on the target system.
You can install unzip via `brew install unzip` on MacOS or
`sudo apt-get install unzip -y` on Linux.

### Docker

Docker is not required during installation, however it's required during runtime
as it's the fundation of how we delivery the software packages. You may install
Docker from https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/
