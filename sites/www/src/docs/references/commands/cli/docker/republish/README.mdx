# docker republish

Republish all related docker images from official registry to target docker registry.


     You have options to override files as `.dinghy_file_override/docker/images/NAME_OF_IMAGE/fs-root` or
     execute additional docker run commands `docker.images.NAME_OF_IMAGE.republishRuns` during the build process.

## Usage
```sh
$ dinghy docker republish [options]
```
## Options
| Name            | Description           | Default                   |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `--[no]-push` | Push the images to the target registry, otherwise the image will only be built and can be used locally | `true`  |
| `--target-repo` | Target docker registry to republish images to. If not provided, the target registry will be read from the Dinghy Config file as `engine.repo`. |   |
